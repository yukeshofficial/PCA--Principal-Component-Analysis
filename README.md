# PCA--Principal-Component-Analysis

## Important points to remember while using PCA. To summarise:

   1.Most software packages use SVD to compute the principal components and assume that the data is scaled and centred, so it is important to do standardisation/normalisation.
   
   2.PCA is a linear transformation method and works well in tandem with linear models such as linear regression, logistic regression etc., though it can be used for computational efficiency with non-linear models as well.
   
   3.It should not be used forcefully to reduce dimensionality (when the features are not correlated).
